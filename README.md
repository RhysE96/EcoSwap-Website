# EcoSwap Website

<p>Here's a nice design I found online. Im trying to get used to the BEM naming convention which seems a bit overkill for a landing page but i can see the use in it for larger projects. Here's a link to the design: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1300726462461630527/ecoswap-landing-page</p>

Here is a screencapture of the entire website in desktop view:
